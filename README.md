# Smart-Speed-Breaker-Based-ON-IOT
The main objective of this project is to control the speed of any vehicles in schools, hospitals and speed in restricted regions etc. Smart speed breakers are the traffic claiming devices where over speeding vehicles will activate the speed breaker and it will raise the speed breaker above the surface of the road and will give the physical remainder to the driver for slowing down the vehicle. If the speed of the vehicle will be in the given allowed speed limit then the speed bumps will remain flat on the surface of the road and the vehicle can pass through it comfortably. In implementation we are using an iron made flat speed breaker which is proficient of rising itself using control circuitry of embedded system. In this project, the Arduino controller relates the speed, if it outstrips the restricted speed the controller warnings the driver and the proximity sensors are used to detect the speed and activate the speed breaker and a warning is shown to the driver using a standard traffic light signal. If the speed exceeds the allowed speed an image is also captured of the vehicle and is sent to the cloud, which can be accessed by RTO for fining the vehicle.
